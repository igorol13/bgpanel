			   WARHAWK's CONTRIBUTORS SPECIAL THANKS
===================================================================

My first thanks goes to "sUpEr g2", for is whole participation to this project.
He was the first one to believe in my project, hosted me for a year on his dedicated server,
reported all bugs and corrected some of them himself. This panel is now what it is by
the suggestions and the points of improvement of "sUpEr g2".
Thank you sUpEr g2.

I would like also thank both "ALpha" and "Soldat Ryan" from "http://beta.tutos-gameserver.fr" (a french
computing community) for your help, by giving me some very useful code, or by testing the panel and
reporting me bugs. Your personal investment encourages me to continue this wonderful project !
Thank you guys.

Also thanks to all people that are following me on Twitter !
